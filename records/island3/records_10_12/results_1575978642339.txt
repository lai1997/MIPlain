responses: [I have castle and fish and I want to have fish, because I can't get a triplet of castle. I think it would have been better to choose the upper left of island 2.,
I thought I wanted to obtain water. But trying to get the entire island would have been better.,
I wanted to obtain the crobs or if that's not possible after the next move of orange get the entire island, and therefore a triplet,
I wanted to obtein crobs here again. I think it would have been more clever to settle for the castle and fish on island 3, beacuse I already had fish,
I wanted to obtein the castle with the fish, because player two got a castle and can't get a triplet and he can't get the water. So I wanted to obtain all the fish, because that's what he doesn't has,
I wanted to have a triplet of castle. I already got two castles, here I claimed the third one]
