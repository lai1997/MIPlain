responses: [I thought I would not give them a chance t pair a castle. Blocking that off made sense.,
If I took the castle and the fish they wouldn't have enough moves to get the most pairs. I could get the tree next.,
I wanted t keep them from the water and corn. They had so few items, I thought I could keep going.,
I already had two castles. that square had 3 items. The next move for the other player wouldn't give them the pairs they needed.,
I wasn't sure on this to be honest.I look now and theis seems like a mistake. I should have picked the square with more items.,
This also seems like a dumb move now. I wasn't thinking ahead enough. They already had corn.]
