responses: [I chose the tile because I thought it would be the optimal move most likely to lead to me winning the game.

I would have multiple options to win.,
I took this tile in order to win the game. I wanted to choose the best tile. I would block the opponent from gaining all three tiles in the bottom island while also gaining a second corn. Then on the next move I could possibly win.,
